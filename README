Developed the ”Home Automation” system with Android mobile app, a C server and remote (home-side) sensors, displays and actuators, consisting of temperature control, security, and energy efficiency
· Designed the system architecture with Finite-State-Machine Analysis and Model-driven development
· Improved code robustness, safety and fault-tolerance using Helgrind, gcov, Memcheck
· Potential extension includes ”smart home” with big data and machine learning
